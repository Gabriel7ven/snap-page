## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

During this project, I strengthened my skills in:

- **HTML Structure**: Creating semantic and accessible markup for navigation menus
- **CSS Styling**: Using Flexbox for responsive layouts, implementing custom properties for maintainability
- **JavaScript Logic**: Developing interactive dropdown menus with event listeners and DOM manipulation


### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels and keyboard navigation)
- Performance optimization for larger projects
- CSS animations and transitions for smoother interactions
- Testing strategies for interactive components
- Utilization of React framework and Tailwind CSS
